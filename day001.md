##Blockly Maze Completion
```
After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? 
Cut and paste and assign it to the variable level_10_code.

How many blocks did you have left? 
Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.

```


level_10_code = '''
while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
    turnRight();
  }
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
}
'''



# Transfer the value from Level 10 "blocks remaining"
# to the variable below 

remaining_blocks = 3


print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)

print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)
