# JugsMugsPugs LITE
```
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 5 and 7, it prints "MugsPugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".

Otherwise, it prints the number.

LITE REQUIREMENT:
Limit your code to use only if statements and not to exceed 4 of them. 
You are a real winner if you can achieve it using not more than 3 if statements.
```
```
a=int(input())
b=""

if a%3==0:
  b+="Jugs"
if a%5==0:
  b+="Mugs"
if a%7==0:
  b+="pugs"
print(b or a)
```

# JugsMugsPugs Plus
```
Write a program that receives a number on the input.

  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

Otherwise, it prints the number.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: 
Try and limit the number of c
```
```
a=int(input())
b=""
c=3

if str(3) in str(a) or a%3==0:
  b+="Jugs"
if str(5) in str(a) or a%5==0:
  b+="Mugs"
if str(7) in str(a) or a%7==0:
  b+="pugs"
print(b or a)
```

# JugsMugsPugsPlus and Reverse
```
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input. 

  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.

REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
   - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
   - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
   - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
   - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
```
```

rev=int(input())

b=""

if rev==0:
  if str(3) in str(a) or a%3==0:
    b+="Jugs"
  if str(5) in str(a) or a%5==0:
    b+="Mugs"
  if str(7) in str(a) or a%7==0:
    b+="pugs"
  print(b or a)
else:
  if str(7) in str(a) or a%7==0:
    b+="pugs"
  if str(5) in str(a) or a%5==0:
    b+="Mugs"
  if str(3) in str(a) or a%3==0:
    b+="Jugs"
  print(b or a)
```

# JugsMugsPugsPlusReverse Range
```
- Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to   
that number subjected to the conditions below. 
- It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input. 

For every number in the given range, 
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.

REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
   - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
   - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
   - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
   - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7

# JugsMugsPugs Special
```
SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: 
Try and limit the number of conditional statements to not more than two. 
This requires some advanced Python language knowledge.
```
```

rev=bool(input())
temp=num
res=""
ar1=['7','5','3']
ar2=["Pugs","Mugs","Jugs"]

  temp=str(j)
  res=""
  for i in range(3):
    if (j%int(ar1[i])==0 or ar1[i] in str(j)):
